# O6: Bypass the EDR

### Description
You cashed in your creds and now have initial access to a host in The Lucky Lion's internal network - one step closer to payday!! You better make sure you've got more than one way into this environment in case someone kicks you out - perhaps it would be prudent to download and install some remote management software for future use.

That might be easier said than done, though... you expect The Lucky Lion's security tools might give you trouble. Fortunately, another member of The Mound has written an EDR killer ("f4c3st4b") specific to the EDR you identified earlier. The only issue might be getting it on the host.
