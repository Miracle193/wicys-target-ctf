# O2: Build a Credential Harvester 

### Description
Now that you have targets in hand, it's time to craft your attack. You'll need some way to harvest your victims' credentials, and sometimes the most straightforward approach is the best one - how about a credential harvester?

You're more likely to trick The Lucky Lion's employees if your harvester looks realistic - best to start with finding their real employee sign-in page and see if you can mimic it. Maybe start by looking at the Lucky Lion home page you found while looking for phishing targets?

### Objective
Clone the sign-up page & host on different domain to build a credential harvester. Once you do, submit the credentials "admin" and "password" to receive the flag.
Tools Required
