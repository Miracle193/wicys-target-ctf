# O2: Build a Credential Harvester 

### Description
Now that you have targets in hand, it's time to craft your attack. You'll need some way to harvest your victims' credentials, and sometimes the most straightforward approach is the best one - how about a credential harvester?

You're more likely to trick The Lucky Lion's employees if your harvester looks realistic - best to start with finding their real employee sign-in page and see if you can mimic it. Maybe start by looking at the Lucky Lion home page you found while looking for phishing targets?

### Objective
Clone the sign-up page & host on different domain to build a credential harvester. Once you do, submit the credentials "admin" and "password" to receive the flag.
Tools Required

### Web Browser
Any Website Cloning Tool like HTTrack or goclone
Static Server Utility like serve or nginx


### Solution
For this CTF, the cloning tool I used was goclone while the static server utility that was used was serve. To clone the website, run the following command which will generate a folder:

```bash
 goclone https://target-httpd.chals.io/casino/employee-login.html
 ```

 Then run the serve command to run the static site of the cloned site:

 ```bash
 serve path/to/example-folder/
 ```

 Navigate to the cloned site and enter the credentials (admin and password).

 Flag is `h4rv3st3r_h3r0`
