# O3: Build a Credential Harvester 

### Description
You have your credential harvester ready to go, but how exactly are you going to trick your victims into visiting the site hosting it? Much like the harvester, your "hook" will work best if it mimicks something legitimate that the victim is expecting to see.

While researching The Lucky Lion leading in preparation for this attack, you had discovered that the casino uses multi-factor authentication for employees. Specifically, you learned that they use Squishy Security, a budget security solution notorious for a host of backdoors. Employees need to scan a QR code to sign up with the service on their company phones, so perhaps we can phish them to click on our harvester? Given this MFA onboarding email, can you engineer an attack QR code to capitalize on Squishy Security's lackluster control mechanisms?

Validate your QR code here to get your flag!

### Objectives
Crack the MFA QR code's security scheme
Submit your own malicious QR code that is the same as the example, except it would redirect to http://wood-chewers.trees instead of the normal casino sign-in. NOTE: if the example QR's text had any special formatting/encryption applied, so should your submitted QR!
Tools Required

A QR code generator (you can find one on CyberChef, as well as potentially other helpful tools for this challenge!)

### Solution
To crack the QR Code using CyberChef:
1. Scan the QR code in CyberChef, this will output a base64 string.
2. Decode the base64 string, this will output a binary.
3. XOR the binary, this will output `0719202207........` in the beginning of the text.
`07192022` is the key we will use to generate the QR code. Notice that the `07192022` is in the footer of the email.

To generate the QR Code:
1. In the output generated from step 3 above, replace the `redirect_url` field with the url, `http://wood-chewers.trees`
2. XOR the text with 07192022
3. Base64 the output
4. QR encode the output.
5. Submit the generated QR code to the grader website to get the flag.

Flag is `flag{WI$h_I'd_Squ!sh3d_Th@t_BuG}`
