# O9.1: Escalate your Privileges

### Description
Things are going well - you've gained initial access to another host on The Lucky Lion's network, but you have limited access with your current privileges. Let's open up a terminal and see if you can change that.

One of the easiest ways to run a command that you don't have permission to execute is to find a file that DOES have the right permissions and have it execute your command for you, all you have to do is find the right file!

Flag Format The file's name in name.extension format (e.g.: example.txt). You don't need to include the path.

### Objectives
Using the NARSH (Not A Real Shell) emulator, find a file with world writable permissions that executes as root.
