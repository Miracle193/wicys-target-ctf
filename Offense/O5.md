# O5: Take Over an EDR Account

### Description
Now that you know the EDR tool in use, you've discovered that the best way to take over assets inside of The Lucky Lion is to gain access to the console of the EDR tool. Given the high-privileged rights that EDR Services run as, getting access to this tool should provide unfettered access to The Lucky Lion's resources!

After taking over the email account utilizing their quished credentials, you learned that the administrator is using a different password for accessing the EDR console. (Yay!) However, you've discovered the Java application that The Lucky Lion is utilizing for OTP and you've zipped it up as Alg_Gen.zip (attached in Files). After dissecting the application, it seems to be a promising (albeit disheartening) path!

To get into the EDR console, you'll need to figure out how to take over the credentials for The Lucky Lion's EDR administrator. How can we go about obtaining the credentials for this user?

### Objectives
Provide the One-Time Password from the vendor to reset the user's password.
