# O1: Trace the Handoff

### Find your Targets
Crack your knuckles and wiggle your fingers - it's time to hack a casino! First things first - you need an entry point. Phishing is a tried and true method and somewhat of a specialty to Tacky Termite, why not start there?

The first step of a well-crafted social engineering campaign is to rustle up some targets - specifically a corporate email. Thankfully the casino has a website chock full of information to get us started. From there, use open source intelligence (OSINT) to find a usable email address.

### Objectives
Find the email address of a Lucky Lion employee, there should be a flag nearby!
