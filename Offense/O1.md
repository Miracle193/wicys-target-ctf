# O1: Trace the Handoff

### Description
Crack your knuckles and wiggle your fingers - it's time to hack a casino! First things first - you need an entry point. Phishing is a tried and true method and somewhat of a specialty to Tacky Termite, why not start there?

The first step of a well-crafted social engineering campaign is to rustle up some targets - specifically a corporate email. Thankfully the casino has a website chock full of information to get us started. From there, use open source intelligence (OSINT) to find a usable email address.

### Objectives
Find the email address of a Lucky Lion employee, there should be a flag nearby!

### Solution
The challenge takes you to the Lucky Lion website where you can see a list of Lucky Lion employees and their social media accounts. If you navigate to each of their accounts, you will come across Camilla G's account on Twitter. Looking at her following list, we see an interesting account - someone named CrypticGuardian at @alexlee387728. The account has a GitHub page linked to it and navigating there we see the flag in the user's bio page.

Flag is `ctf{maybeD0ntLISTtheC0rpEm@il}`
