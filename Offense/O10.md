At this point it's safe to say you've won the jackpot. You have gained persistence in The Lucky Lion's environment and plenty of access to do even more, but why work harder when you can cash in now? Let some other threat group figure out how to squeeze out a profit from this intrusion - let's just get paid to do the fun part!

Time to head to the dark web to sell your access. Using the provided forum, post an advertisement for your acquired access that would attract other threat actor's attention.

### Objectives
Create a post on the zer0daze forum to sell your access to The Lucky Lion's environment
