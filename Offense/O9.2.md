# O9.2: Escalate your Privileges

### Description
Ok now you're rockin' - you're one step further to gaining root access to a host on the Lucky Lion network.

Now that you've identified the file with improperly set permissions and the cronjob that executes the file, you were able to modify the file by adding the below command that will be executed as the file owner.

The following command will copy /bin/bash to /tmp and set the user or group ID on execution. This will effectively execute the file as root.

```bash
cp /bin/bash /tmp && chmod +s /tmp/bash
```

But how can you obtain a root shell to successfully elevate your privileges?

Flag Format: The exact command that would give you a root shell; include the full path and any arguments/flags for the command.
