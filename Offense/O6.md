# O6: Find a Way In

### Description
Now that you have some credentials, let's find somewhere to use them!

You fire up Nmap, your trusty network mapper, and configure a scan to identify hosts in The Lucky Lion's IP space that are online and reachable.

You've found one server in particular that looks like a potentially juicy target, but to know for sure whether the host will have something you can sign into with your stolen credentials, you'll need to know what services are open. Use Nmap to scan this server to determine which services specifically are available.

### Objectives
Determine the name of the services running on the server of interest
