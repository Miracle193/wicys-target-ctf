# D7.2: Review Connection Logs (Host A)

### Files: ad_svc.trace

### Description
Now that we have identified where the logs are, let's take a look at one of the files and see what we can learn about our threat actor.

Based on our OSINT research in the previous flag, can we identify which fields in the attached ad_scv.trace log identify our attacker?

### Objectives
Review host artifacts to identify who and when our victim's PC was accessed. Answer both of the following questions to create the flag:
* What is the exact timestamp when the connection was opened?
* What is the the IP address of the remote host connecting to Bob's computer?

Submit your answer comma separated so that it matches the following format: YYYY-MM-DD 00:00:00.000,IP.IP.IP.IP

### Solution
Reviewing the `ad_svc.trace` trace file will be able to answer the general questions:
* What is the exact timestamp when the connection was opened? 2024-04-18 06:42:31.190 
* What is the the IP address of the remote host connecting to Bob's computer? 203.0.161.68

Flag is `2024-04-18 06:42:31.190,203.0.161.68`
