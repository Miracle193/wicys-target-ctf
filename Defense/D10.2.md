# D10.1: Strelka Analysis

### Objectives
What is the epoch timestamp of the Portable Executable (PE) file?

### Solution
In the context of a Portable Executable (PE) file, the epoch timestamp is a specific field that records the date and time when the file was created or last modified. This timestamp is stored in the PE header and is used for various purposes, including debugging and versioning.

In the `output.json` file we retrieved in [D10.1](D10.1.md), search for `compile_time`. The timestamp is revealed to be `2024-05-04T13:37:00`.

Open CyberChef and use the "To UNIX Timestamp" converter to convert the timestamp to epoch timestamp.

Flag is `1714829820`
