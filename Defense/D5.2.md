# D5.2: Identify compromised user

### Files: suricata_alert.json

### Description
Alright, we have a good idea of how many users visited the known malicious site, but we should also try to see whether these users actually submitted credentials to the harvester, so let's take a closer look at our Suricata alert logs.

Reviewing the traffic, what field and value indicates that credentials may have been sent to the malicious site?

### Objectives
Enter the field name that indicates a user credentials may have been sent to the malicious site and its value, exactly as in the log (i.e. "field_name": "value").

### Solution
Since we are looking for indication that a user credential was 'submitted', we are looking for a post request. In the `suricata_alert.json` file, filter 'post' to find if a post request was done. This shows there is one POST request to the malicious site, "wood-chewers.trees".

Flag is `"http_method": "POST"`
