# D4: Investigate a Suspicious Email

### Description
Now that we have the threat actor's cred harvesting site (wood-chewers.trees), let's write a detection rule using Suricata to alert on HTTP traffic going out from The Lucky Lion's network to the domain.

Given the Suricata rule below, can you fill in the missing information to complete the rule?

```suricata
alert http $CORP_NET any -> $EXTERNAL_NET any (msg:"Detected traffic to wood-chewers.trees"; http.host; _____________; sid:1000001; rev:1;)
```

### Objectives
Enter the missing information to complete the Suricata rule

### Solution
In a Suricata rule, `content` is a keyword used to specify the exact pattern or string that the rule is looking for in the payload of a network packet. The packets we are looking for should have the cred harvesting site (wood-chewers.trees) in it. Therefore the missing information in the rule is `content:"wood-chewers.trees"`.

Flag is `content:"wood-chewers.trees"`
