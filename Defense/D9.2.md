# D9.2: Review Connection Logs (Host B)

### Files: ad.trace, user.conf, ad_svc.trace

### Description
Thanks to the Yara rule you developed, we received an alert detecting the AnyDesk hash on another host. Let's take a look at the logs to see if we can get an idea of what more the threat actor did on this host.

### Objectives
Determine the name of the directory that the threat actor successfully dropped a file into on our victim host. Enter as normalized path beginning with "C:"
Tools Required A text editor like Notepad++ can be used to open the attached .trace file.

### Solution
Looking at the logs in user.conf, you can see the file path the the threat actor dropped the file in is set to `ad.session.local_browser_start_path=1157184190:C*\\Users\\wctf24\\AppData\\Local\\Temp`

Flag is `C:\Users\wctf24\AppData\Local\Temp`
