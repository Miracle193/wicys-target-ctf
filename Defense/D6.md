# D6: PCAP Analysis

### Files: pcap.zip

### Description
You have been given a PCAP file of Bob's browsing traffic concerning a known Remote Access tool. You'll need to examine the PCAP to determine which tool was downloaded on the host and where it came from.

Password for Zip: infected

General Questions:

* Did the user have any suspicious downloads?
* What is the purpose of the executable?
* What was the domain the executable was downloaded from?
* What is the source port?

### Objectives
Determine if there was a suspicious download, what it was, and where it came from. Identify the full request URI that the executable was downloaded from.

### Solution
For this CTF, I used Wireshark to analyze the pcap file. In Wireshark, filter for `http` packets. Packet 23 contains the request for the suspicious download. Selecting the packet, you willl see the the URI in the "Full Request URI" field.

To answer the general questions:
* Did the user have any suspicious downloads? Yes
* What is the purpose of the executable? Chat
* What was the domain the executable was downloaded from? hxxp[://]anydesk[.]com:8000/AnyDesk[.]exe (defanged)
* What is the source port? 45944

Flag is `http://anydesk.com:8000/AnyDesk.exe`
