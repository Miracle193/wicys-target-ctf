# D11: Trace the Handoff

### Description
At this point, it's safe to say a threat actor has infiltrated The Lucky Lion's network, and from your experience, you know that threat actors tend to sell access as an easy way to monetize their efforts. As a defender, you may have to do some of your own researching to find relevant advertisements and dig deeper to find any additional information that can help your team assess the threat.

Fortunately, there are services available that attempt to catalogue the deep and dark web so that security researchers can stay on top of emerging threats and track otherwise elusive threat actors. One such service is Insightful Horizon, which Lucky Lion has access to! It tracks deep/dark web forum posts and tracks Bitcoin transactions "of interest" through a proprietary algorithm.

### Objectives 
Use the search engine to pivot and find the Tox ID of the threat actor who bought access to the casino!

Username: analyst
Password: feelinglucky
Flag Format A Tox ID, which is 76 hexadecimal digits, case-insensitive. Example: 11C0152AD2FB0C137C9BD6AC07C67AFC44AA7E7842A345C0F54A0412E55A9D26992A9C50BCE0

### Solution
In the website, trace the transactions/communications from posts table to by searching for a transaction with the keyword of `Lucky Lion`. A transaction with the title of "Feeling Lucky? We'd be Lion if we said we weren't" is shown. Copy the `crypto_wallet` value from that transaction and navigate to the btc_transaction table.

In the btc_transaction table, search for the transaction using the `crypto_wallet` value you copied from the posts table. This outputs the below:
