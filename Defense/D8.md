# D8: YARA Analysis

### Files: strelka.json

### Description
You and the rest of The Lucky Lion's IR team are deep in your investigation, digging into hosts with signs of unusual activity. While pulling artifacts from host A (WDIGCVY2S), you identified the tool download utilized by the threat actor. You capture the file and submit it to Strelka, a real-time, container-based file scanning system used for threat hunting, threat detection, and incident response. The strelka.json results identified the file as AnyDesk and you determined the file was downloaded and utilized by the threat actor.

### Objectives
Create a YARA rule that will detect the target file. The target file has similar meta information identified in strelka.json. There are a total of 100 files, only one is the target file.
Flag Format Typical CTF flag th4t_l00kz_l1k3_th1s

## Solution
In YARA rule, the PE module exposes most of the fields present in a PE header and provides functions which can be used to write more expressive and targeted rules. For our YARA rule, we will use the PE module to create our YARA rule which will be saved in `myrule.yar`. 

```yara
import "pe"

rule test 
{ 
    strings: 
        $file_version = "8.0.10" 
        $id = "332" 
        $filename = "AnyDesk" 
        $company = "GmbH"       
    condition: 
        all of them and 
        filesize >= 5203KB and 
        pe.checksum == 5359632
}
```

Run the command through the curl command
```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: text/plain" https://target- flask.chals.io/api/v1/yara-scan -X POST -d @myrule.yar
```

Flag is `y3t_an0th3r_r3curs1v3_acr0nym`
