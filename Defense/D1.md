# D1: Secure Your Perimter

### Files: network_diagram.py, vulnerability_report.json

### Description:
After receiving a tip from a peer organization's Cyber Threat Intelligence team that prolific threat actor group Tacky Termite recently posted that they're gearing up to cyber-heist a casino, you've been tasked with making sure The Lucky Lion Casino is secured against any such cyber attacks.

As if it were that simple! You know it's impossible for any company to be fully protected against attacks, but you can certainly make it more difficult for any would-be attacker.

Let's start by eliminating any easy entry points by scanning The Lucky Lion's network for vulnerabilities. After running your vulnerability scanning tool Centauros, you now have a very long list of potential security issues impacting hosts in your environment.

It would definitely be best to remediate ALL of these issues, but who knows how much time you have before an attacker also discovers the vulnerabilities? You will need to prioritize the most critical issues first - take a look at the list and identify the CVE of the vulnerability that would be most prudent to remediate quickly.

### Objectives:
Identify the most critical vulnerability that should be remediated first.

### Solution:
Since we are looking to eliminate any easy entry points, we will focus on finding the critical vulnerabilities in the DMZ area highlighted in the `network_diagram.png` file. 3/4 of the servers do not appear in the `vulnerability_report.json` file except the "ar276joiu" server. When we look at the list of vulnerabilities for that server, we see that CVE-2024-29994 is the only vulnerability with the `severity_name` of "Critical".

Flag is `CVE-2024-29994`
