# D7.1: Review Connection Logs (Host A)

### Description
We have identified our host and user in The Lucky Lion's environment that may have been accessed by a malicious actor. In the previous challenge, we identified AnyDesk was downloaded via PCAP analysis on our suspect host. Let's perform some artifact analysis from that host in order to see what the threat actor may have done with AnyDesk.

Let's look at our compromised user's (bob_wctf24) Windows host WDIGCVY2S. AnyDesk can be used to remotely connect to a host, drop payloads, and steal files, but it should leave traces we can use in our investigation.

Can you use your security research skills and find out where the logs for AnyDesk are located?

### Objectives
Locate the artifacts we need to assess suspicious activity on our host by finding the full path (beginning with C:) to the directory where AnyDesk's logs would be on our host.

### Solution
A quick Google search of where the directory for the log files of AnyDesk shows as `C:\Users\%Username%\Appdata\Roaming\AnyDesk`. In that case for the compromised user, bob_wctf24, the directory would be `C:\Users\bob_wctf24\Appdata\Roaming\AnyDesk`.

Flag is `C:\Users\bob_wctf24\Appdata\Roaming\AnyDesk`
