# D10.3: Strelka Analysis

### Objectives
What is the PE checksum in hex?
1234567 == 12D687

### Solution
In the `output.json` file we retrieved in [D10.1](D10.1.md), search for `checksum`. The PE checksum is revealed to be `463362`.

To convert 463362 to hex, go to CyberChef and select 'To Base' and set the radix as 16.

Alternatively, to convert 463362 to hex:
1. 463362 ÷ 16 = 28960 remainder 2
2. 28960 ÷ 16 = 1810 remainder 0
3. 1810 ÷ 16 = 113 remainder 2
4. 113 ÷ 16 = 7 remainder 1
5. 7 ÷ 16 = 0 remainder 7

Flag is `71202`
