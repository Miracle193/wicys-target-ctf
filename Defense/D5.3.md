# D5.3: Identify compromised user

### Files: suricata_alert.json

### Description
Let's take one final look at our alert logs. We've now identified the HTTP_method indicating credentials were sent to the phishing domain.

### Objectives
What is the IP address that was responsible for that traffic?

### Solution
In the `suricata_alert.json` file, filter 'src_ip' to find the IP address of the user who sent the POST HTTP request.

Flag is `10.15.38.78`
