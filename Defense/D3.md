# D3: Investigate a Suspicious Email

### Link: https://target-httpd.chals.io/phish_attempt.html

### Description
While you're keeping an eye on incoming alerts, you notice an email pop into The Lucky Lion's security inbox from a concerned employee. They report receiving an unexpected email asking them to verify their identity.

There might be hidden evidence of tampering in this email, since on the surface it looks legitimate. Can you figure out where the attacker might have left a calling card?

### Objectives
Find the evidence of attacker tampering (will have the format flag{.........})

### Solution
The above link takes you to the suspicious email which has a QR code attached to it. Scanning the QR code will provide the text: `synt{rirel_pgs_arrqf_ebg13}`. 

Looking at the text, it was obvious that this is a ciphertext of some sorts. I navigated to the CyberChef web app and played around with some tools to decipher the encryption. Finally, what worked was the ROT13 cipher.

Flag is `flag{every_ctf_needs_rot13}`
