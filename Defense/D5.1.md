# D5.1: Identify compromised user

### Files: suricata_alert.json

### Description
Now that we have detection in place for the threat actor's credential harvesting site, we can review the alerting logs in an attempt to identify any compromised users.

The attached .json file is an output from our Suricata rule.

Review our detection logs to identify network traffic to the cred harvester. Using these logs, we need to identify users who may have been compromised, and then identify the specific user and host we should start analyzing first. To start, we should figure out how many users in total we need to look into.

### Objectives
* Based on our logs, how many users or hosts does it appear had traffic to the credential harvesting site were there? Enter response as an integer.

### Solution
In the `suricata_alert.json` file, filter 'src_ip' and calculate the number of times it appears. That is the number of users that had traffic to the credential harvesting site.

Flag is `8`
