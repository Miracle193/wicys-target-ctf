# D9.1: Review Connection Logs (Host B)

### Files: ad.trace, user.conf, ad_svc.trace

### Description
Thanks to the Yara rule you developed, we received an alert detecting the AnyDesk hash on another host. Let's take a look at the logs to see if we can get an idea of what more the threat actor did on this host.

Once again, let's try to OSINT our way into deciphering these AnyDesk logs.

### Objectives
Analyze a second host's connection logs for further indicators of compromise by answering the following questions to construct your flag:
* Given these AnyDesk log files, can you determine whether the threat actor uploaded to or downloaded from our internal host?
* What is the directory name of the folder on the threat actor's machine?
* What is the port number over which our internal host has accepted the connection?

Submit your flag by combining the above three answers into a comma-separated string, such that it matches the format: uploadordownload,directoryname,port# (here's an example flag correctly formatted (though the incorrect flag): upload,program_files,82747)

### Solution
Analyze the 3 files given for the CTFs to answer the questions. Analyzing the `ad.trace` file, we can conclude the threat actor uploaded to the internal host. In the `user.conf` file, the directory name of the folder on the threat actor's machine is fun_files. In `ad_svc.trace`, the port number over which out internal host has accepted the connection is 57836.

Flag is `upload,fun_files,57836`
