# D10.1: Strelka Analysis

### Description
During host analysis, the IR team identified the suspicious file C:\Users\wctf24\AppData\Local\Temp\img_001.scr. As the malware analyst on shift, you need to quickly determine if the file is malicious. Your automated Strelka sandbox can provide detailed information about the file. Submit the path of the suspicious file and the hostname to the API.

### Objectives
Determine the SHA256 hash of the file.

### Tools Required
curl

### Solution
In order to find the host name, I reviewed the previous Defense CTFs' descriptions and came across the hostname mentioned in [D5.4](D5.4.md) (Host name is WDIGCVY2S). 

Now that we have the host name, all that's left is to pass a .json to the curl command to get the Strelka JSON results which contains the SHA256 hash of the file:

```json 
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://target-flask.chals.io/api/v1/strelka -o output.json -X POST -d '{"host": "WDIGCVY6S", "path": "C:\\Users\\wctf24\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\img_001.scr"}'
```

Notice we had to use the escape the \ .

Open the `output.json` file and search for `sha256`.

Flag is `31d12f8b9f75d0b4b38a8c3a5e81e0a040a40f544122742e3c8dd700f687c910`
